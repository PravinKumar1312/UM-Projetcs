        <p>Hello Everyone!<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for visiting my site. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out—I'll be happy to connect!<br>
          I'm Pravin Kumar GS, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Educational Technology at VIT Bhopal University. I'm passionate about technology and the automobile industry, always eager to explore and learn more.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying through the pandemic taught me adaptability and self-learning—skills I carry with me today. I'm also an avid anime fan, especially inspired by side characters who quietly make a big impact—something I aim to reflect in my own life.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to browse through my portfolio and get to know my projects and skills!
